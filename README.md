## This Repository

- **data.zip** contains the Multi3WOZ dataset in four languages: Arabic (Afro-Asiatic), English (Indo-European), French (Indo-European), and Turkish (Turkic). Each language includes 9,160 multi-parallel dialogues.

- **code** directory contains the baseline code to reproduce our experimental results in the paper. We provide our baseline code for all the popular ToD tasks: natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue state tracking (DST), and natural language generation (NLG).

## Baselines

Before running the experiments, please run the following command to uncompress the data 

```bash
>> unzip data.zip
```

Then follow each baseline directory's instructions to reproduce our reported results. For example, please follow [./code/nlu/README.md](./code/nlu/README.md) to reproduce our reported NLU results.
